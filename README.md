# Java File Sorter

This is a Java application that organizes files in a specific directory based on the its extension.


## Background
Every a few months I need to spend some time to organize my files in my download dirctory. To save in the future, I decided to develop a Java program that automatically organizes each file based on its extension.


## Functionalities
1. File Organization: The program will scan a specified directory (e.g., download directory) and identify all the files present in it.
2. File Extension Identification: It will extract the file extension of each file in the directory.
3. Grouping Files: The program will categorize the files based on their file extensions. For example, it will group all image files together, all text files together, etc.
4. Creation of Subdirectories: Once the files are categorized, the program will create subdirectories (folders) for each unique file extension.
5. Moving Files: The program will then move each file to its corresponding subdirectory based on its file extension.
6. Automation: The Java File Sorter program will provide automation, allowing the user to run it whenever needed without manual intervention.
7. Ease of Use: It will have a user-friendly interface or command-line interface, making it easy for users to specify the target directory and initiate the sorting process.
  

## How to Use this Project
You will need:
1. Your own config file to store the specified directory path.
